# RAG-AI-chat-model-for-document

## Project Overview
This project involves a series of Python scripts designed to convert PDF documents into text format, segment the text into manageable chunks, and store these chunks in a Chroma vector database. The database utilizes embeddings generated by OpenAI's models to facilitate efficient retrieval of text based on query relevance. Additionally, the project incorporates an AI-driven chat model to generate responses based on the context retrieved from the database.

## Features
- **PDF to Markdown Conversion**: Converts PDF documents to a cleaner markdown-like format.
- **Text Chunking**: Splits large text files into smaller, indexed chunks for better handling.
- **Vector Database Storage**: Utilizes OpenAI embeddings to store text chunks in a Chroma vector database, allowing for efficient query handling and retrieval.
- **AI-Driven Response Generation**: Uses an advanced AI chat model to generate responses based on the text retrieved from the database.

## Dependencies
- `pdfminer.six`
- `langchain`
- `chroma`
- `openai`
- `logging`
- `os`
- `shutil`
- `re`
- `time`

## Configuration
Make sure to replace placeholders such as `your file location` and `Your OpenAI API key` with actual data and credentials.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Convert PDFs to Text**: Place your PDF files in the designated folder and run the conversion script:
   ```python
   python pdf_to_markdown.py
   ```

2. **Load and Split Text**: Execute the script to load text documents, split them, and store them in the Chroma database:
   ```python
   python generate_data_store.py
   ```

3. **Query Handling and Response Generation**: Perform text-based queries and generate responses:
   ```python
   python query_and_respond.py
   ```
