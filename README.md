# RAG-AI-chat-model-for-document

**Project Overview**
  This project involves a series of Python scripts designed to convert PDF documents into text format, segment the text into manageable chunks, and store these chunks in a Chroma vector database. The database utilizes embeddings generated by OpenAI's models to facilitate efficient retrieval of text based on query relevance. Additionally, the project incorporates an AI-driven chat model to generate responses based on the context retrieved from the database.

**Features**
 -  PDF to Markdown Conversion: Converts PDF documents to a cleaner markdown-like format.
 -  Text Chunking: Splits large text files into smaller, indexed chunks for better handling.
 -  Vector Database Storage: Utilizes OpenAI embeddings to store text chunks in a Chroma vector database, allowing for efficient query handling and retrieval.
 -  AI-Driven Response Generation: Uses an advanced AI chat model to generate responses based on the text retrieved from the database.
